        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>My name and what I prefer to be called...</h2>
        <p>Just "Khai" is fine (pronounced the same as "Kai", because some people do have trouble pronouncing it).</p>
        <h2>My OSU email address...</h2>
        <p>phankha@oregonstate.edu</p>
        <h2>My major and year of study...</h2>
        <p>I'm majoring in CS (Computer Science). It is my second year here at OSU.</p>
        <h2>What is the most complex or interesting thing I've done with my current web development skills?</h2>
        <p>I have tried studying HTML before when I was really young, probably around early middle school, but I couldn't make heads or tails of it so I gave up.
            I am essentially completely new to Web Development and haven't done anything complex or interesting yet.
        </p>
        <h2>What do I hope to learn from this class?</h2>
        <p>I am planning on doing Web Development for my Applied option; this class will help me discover if I truly want to pursue the
            Web Development option. If I do want to do it, then this class will teach me the languages and skills necessary for the higher level classes.
        </p>
        <h2>Have I signed up for our course Piazza forum?</h2>
        <p>Yes sir boss man, I indeed have signed up for the CS 290 Piazza forum.</p>
        <h2>A description of the most interesting fact about me or the most unique experience I've had...</h2>
        <p>The most interesting fact about me is the fact that <strong>there is no interesting fact about me</strong>. Crazy right?
            But if that doesn't count then I guess the most interesting thing about me is that I am left handed, and I often suffer from
            smearing my hand over my writing resulting in lead marks on the side of my hand along with the awkward arm positions from writing
            left-handed on a right-handed desk (I don't go out of my way to get a left-handed desk).

        <h2>A photo of me I guess (super secret!!!!)</h2>
