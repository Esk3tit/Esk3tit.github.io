        <p>Getting started with HTML wasn't very difficult after you get used to the unusual markup syntax.
            The hardest thing to implement was the photo, because I couldn't get the image to show up properly. It just
            displayed the alt text each time. I didn't know what constituted a valid URL for the image to show and whether
            others could see a photo that was local on my computer. Turns out that for your own photos, the most convenient way
            to integrate it into your website is to do it "locally" with file paths instead of uploading it to some site and
            using the URL. The only time the URL should be used is for something that is already online (like stuff from Google Images).
            If it is your own image from your machine then it is best to upload the image alongside your own HTML files and use a
            relative path as the img src instead of going out of your way to try to use a cloud storage URL or something similar. It saves
            time and also the trouble of having to change the URL in case something happens to it because the image is not bound to the current base URL.
            If the URL changes then an absolute URL path would break and you would need to recode all the URLs for the images, whereas the tags in
            relative addresses will still apply even with changes. I paid the ultimate price in order to learn this lesson;
            I'm certainly not getting that hour and a half back. My classmate was the most helpful resource because 
            he confirmed that using relative paths and an image file was the way to go.
